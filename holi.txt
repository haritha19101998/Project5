In the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other.
 The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love.
There is a symbolic legend behind the festival.
 In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour.
 His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted.
 This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's face has been commemorated as Holi.

It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius
